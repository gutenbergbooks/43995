<div class='adtitle2'>PETER PARLEY'S<br />

VISIT TO LONDON.</div>




<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>PARLEY ARRIVES IN LONDON.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>, my little friends, here is your old
acquaintance, Peter Parley, come to tell some
more of his amusing Tales. You wonder,
I dare say, what could tempt such a frail old
man as I am to leave home, and come so far.
You shall hear.</div>

<p>"A Coronation, you must know, is a sight
not to be seen every day in the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
States, where we have neither King nor Queen,
so thinks I to myself, I hear a great deal
about the grandeur of the spectacle which is
to be exhibited at the crowning of Queen
Victoria, and though I have seen many grand
sights in my day, I have never seen a Coronation,
so I shall just get into one of these
new steam ships which take one across the
Atlantic Ocean so quickly, and have a look at
the affair. I shall, besides, have an opportunity
of seeing the kind London friends who
treated me so handsomely when I was last in
England, and then I shall have such lots of
new stories for my young friends. I must&mdash;I
shall go!</p>

<p>"Peter Parley is not a man to spend much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
time in idling after having formed a resolution,
so the very next day, having bid my old
housekeeper good bye, I was on my way
to New York.</p>

<p>"As soon as I arrived at New York, I
made enquiries about the steam ships, and,
finding that the 'Great Western' was to sail
very soon, I secured my passage in her, and
then went to visit my friends in that city, for
I always like to fulfil the old adage, and finish
my work before I begin to play.</p>

<p>"Every body was surprised at my undertaking,
and some kind folks wanted to persuade
me to stay at home, thinking to frighten me
by telling me about the length of the voyage,
&amp;c. They did not know Peter Parley. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
wag, who wished to be very witty, asked me
why I did not wait and take my passage in
the new American ship, the 'Horse-Alligator,'
which was to sail on the 25th of June, and
arrive in London the day before! I could
not help laughing at the idea, but I told him
that steam was quick enough for me.</p>

<p>"I have already told you about my voyages
across the Atlantic, so I need do no more now
than make just one passing remark on the
splendour of the fitting-up, and the admirable
arrangements of the 'Great Western.' We
passed a great many vessels as we came along,
especially when we were not far distant from
the American and English shores. They had
no chance with us. Sometimes we discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them far a-head, like mere specks on the
ocean. In an hour or two we came up with
them, and, in as much more time, left them
far behind. The steady and untiring whirl
of the steamer's paddles carried every thing
before it.</p>

<p>"We reached Bristol in thirteen days, and,
as I had nothing to detain me there, I hurried
on to London, and arrived in the middle of the
grand preparations.</p>

<p>"Every body was as busy as a bee.&mdash;Nothing
was talked of but the Coronation.
'Oh! Mr. Parley, have you come to see the
Coronation too?' was my first salute from
every lip. My kind old friend, Major Meadows,
insisted on my taking up my quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in his house, and promised that I should see
every thing that was to be seen, and hear
every thing that was to be heard. This was
just what I wanted to be at, so I fixed myself
with him at once."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>PARLEY GOES TO SEE THE NEW CROWN.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">After</span> paying a few visits, and renewing
old friendships, I set myself, in good earnest,
to see what was to be seen.</div>

<p>"The most attractive object, connected
with the Coronation, exhibiting at the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was the new crown made for the occasion. I
accordingly made the best of my way into
the city, to the shop of Messrs. Rundell and
Bridge, her Majesty's goldsmiths, on Ludgate
Hill, who, with the greatest liberality, had
thrown open their rooms that the public might
have an opportunity of inspecting the crown.</p>

<p>"So great was the crowd, all anxious to
have a peep, that it was some time before I
could press forward to the door of the shop.
Carriages were so busy taking up and setting
down company, that the street was quite
blocked up. At length, however, by dint
of perseverance, Peter Parley managed to
squeeze in.</p>

<p>"After traversing the shop, all round which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
are ranged articles of the most massive and
costly description, we were ushered into an
interior apartment, in which, in glass cases,
were deposited the precious curiosities.</p>

<p>"In the centre, the admired of all beholders,
was the Royal Crown. It is beautifully
designed, and formed in the most costly and
elegant manner, and so covered with precious
stones, as almost to dazzle the eyes of old
Peter Parley. It is composed of hoops of
silver, enclosing a cap of deep purple velvet.
The hoops are completely covered and concealed
by precious stones, the whole surmounted
by a ball covered with small
diamonds, and having a Maltese cross of
brilliants on the top of it. The body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
crown is wreathed with fleurs-de-lis and Maltese
crosses; the one in the front being ornamented
with a very large heart-shaped ruby,
once, I was informed, a principal ornament in
the crown of Edward the Black Prince, and
which he is said to have worn at the battle of
Cressy. Peter Parley cannot remember all
the details, for besides these, there are many
other precious stones in the crown. The rim
is surrounded with ermine, and it certainly
struck me as being one of the finest things I
had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Close beside the crown were the coronets
of the Royal Dukes and Duchesses, but
though they also were made of costly materials,
the attractions of the crown were so great as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to throw the others quite into the back ground.
I had hardly time to turn my eyes toward the
case containing the Orb and Sword of state,
before I was hurried away by the pressure of
the crowd behind, which kept pouring in in
undiminished numbers.</p>

<p>"As I moved towards the door behind the
shop, which was set apart for visitors retiring,
I passed a table on which was displayed a
service of massive gold utensils, to be used in
the consecration service.</p>

<p>"When I reached the street, I found it still
densely crowded. I wanted to go to St.
Paul's, which stands close by, but was afraid
to venture into such a crowd, so I directed my
steps to Westminster Abbey, making my way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
with some difficulty down Ludgate Hill and
along Fleet Street, and passing beneath
Temple Bar, which marks the boundary of
the City."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>PARLEY VISITS WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND HYDE-PARK.
PREPARATIONS FOR THE FAIR.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">As</span> I approached the venerable pile I found
all in bustle and confusion. Every where
carpenters were busily engaged fitting up
galleries for the accommodation of spectators
of the procession on the day of the coronation.
Ranges of such erections lined the whole
course of the street through which the procession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was to pass, up to the very door of the
Abbey; even the church-yard was lined with
them. These I was told were the speculations
of tradesmen, who let the sittings according
to the value of the situation, at prices
varying from half-a-sovereign up to a couple
of guineas. For some very choice places
even five guineas was asked.</div>

<p>"Peter Parley could not help smiling at the
fine names which had been given to some of
these erections; such as the 'Royal Victoria
Gallery,' the 'Royal Kent Gallery,' &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"By order of the Earl Marshal no visitors
were permitted to enter the Abbey; but as
good luck would have it, just as I happened
to be passing the western grand entrance I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
met a gentleman connected with the Board of
Works, whom I had seen at Major Meadows's
the day before, and who most obligingly
offered to introduce me.</p>

<p>"I gladly availed myself of his invitation,
and was much struck with the grandeur and
extent of the preparations.</p>

<p>"At the western entrance to the Abbey a
suite of apartments for robing-rooms for her
Majesty and the members of the Royal Family
had been erected. So completely did
this structure harmonize externally with the
rest of the antique building, that I should
not have observed that it was a temporary
erection had it not been pointed out to me.
The chamber set apart for her Majesty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fitted up in the most gorgeous manner&mdash;the
walls beautifully ornamented, and the furniture,
all of the richest and most magnificent
description. Though less costly the apartments
for the Royal Family were equally
chaste.</p>

<p>"The interior of the Abbey presented a
scene at once animated and beautiful.
Workmen were busily engaged in various
parts finishing the preparations. I will have
occasion to tell you about the interior of the
Abbey by and by, so I may as well say
nothing about it at present.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley now proceeded to Hyde-Park
to see the preparations for the grand
fair which was to be held in that noble pleasure-ground
on this joyous occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Already many booths displayed themselves
on the plain, and many more were in the act
of being erected. Richardson, who Peter
Parley understood is one of the most famous
of the show-folks, had erected a large and
handsome theatre, which even thus early
seemed to have considerable attractions for
the multitude who had gathered round it in
great numbers.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley having seen all that was
worth seeing in the fair was beginning to
feel tired, and was directing his steps homeward,
when all of a sudden his attention was
attracted to a particular part of the Park to
which people seemed to be hastening from all
quarters. Peter Parley hurried to the spot and
was most agreeably surprised to find that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was Queen Victoria, accompanied by her
suite, taking her accustomed airing in her
carriage."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>PARLEY SEES THE QUEEN, AND RELATES SOME ANECDOTES
OF HER MAJESTY.</small></h2>


<p>"'<span class="smcap">What</span> a dear sweet lady!' were the first
words of Peter Parley when the Royal cavalcade
had passed.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class='attrib'><i>Madeley lith. 3, Wellington St. Strand.</i></div>
<div class="caption">HER MAJESTY LEAVING BUCKINGHAM PALACE ON THE MORNING OF THE CORONATION.</div>
</div>

<p>"'She is a dear sweet lady, Mr. Parley,
and, what is more, she is as good as she is
sweet,' said my friend, Major Meadows, who,
afraid lest I should overwalk myself in my
zeal for sight-seeing, had followed me from
Westminster Abbey and luckily fallen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with me in the park, and he went on to
relate many very interesting anecdotes of
the young Queen, which Peter Parley took
good care to remember because he knew
they would gratify his young friends."</p>

<p>"'Her Majesty is doatingly fond of children,
Mr. Parley,' said he, 'and that you
know is always the sign of a good heart.
Nothing can be finer than the traits of character
exhibited in a little anecdote which
Lady M&mdash;&mdash; told me a day or two ago.</p>

<p>"'Not long since, her Majesty commanded
Lady Barham, one of the ladies in waiting, to
bring her family of lovely children to the
new palace. They were greatly admired and
fondly caressed by the Queen; when a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
little boy about three years of age artlessly
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I do not see the Queen; I want to see
the Queen;' upon which her Majesty, smiling,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I am the Queen, love;' and taking her
little guest into her arms repeatedly kissed
the astonished child.</p>

<p>"This little anecdote warmed old Peter
Parley's heart towards the young Queen; nor
did any of the stories which Major Meadows
told me tend to lessen my regard
for her. Peter Parley was pleased to hear
that she has a proper sense of the importance
of the station to which she has been called
by Divine Providence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the day on which she was proclaimed
Queen of Great Britain she arrived in company
with her royal mother at St. James's
Palace for the purpose of taking part in the
important ceremony. As they drove towards
the palace the party received the most affectionate
demonstrations of loyalty and attachment,
the people following the carriages with
a continuous cry of 'Long live the Queen'&mdash;'God
bless our youthful Queen, long may
she live,' &amp;c. Yet, exciting and exhilirating
as were these acclamations, her Majesty's
countenance exhibited marks only of anxiety
and grief.</p>

<p>"They arrived at St. James's Palace a little
before ten o'clock. When the old bell of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
palace-clock announced that hour, the band
struck up the National Anthem, the Park and
Tower guns fired a double royal salute, and
the young and trembling Queen, led by
the Marquis of Lansdowne, President of the
Council, appeared at an open window looking
into the great court of the Palace. At
the fervent and enthusiastic shout of the
people who had come to witness the ceremony,
her Majesty burst into tears, and, in
spite of all her efforts to restrain them, they
continued to flow down her pale cheeks all
the time she remained at the window. Her
emotions did not, however, prevent her from
returning her acknowledgments for the devotedness
of her people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some of the most interesting anecdotes
which Peter Parley heard, however, related
to an earlier period of the Queen's life,
when she was Princess Victoria.</p>

<p>"'Here is an anecdote which I heard at a
Missionary Meeting, Mr. Parley,' said Major
Meadows, 'and I assure you it told with
great effect.'"</p>

<p>"A poor but truly pious widow, placed in
charge of a lighthouse on the south coast of
the Mersey, had resolved to devote the receipts
of one day in the year, during the
visiting season, to the Missionary cause. On
one of these days, a lady in widow's weeds
and a little girl in deep mourning came to see
the lighthouse; sympathy in misfortune led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to conversation, and before the unknown
visitor took her departure they had most
probably mingled their tears together. The
lady left behind her a sovereign. The unusually
large gratuity immediately caused a
conflict in the breast of the poor woman, as
to whether she was absolutely bound to appropriate
the whole of it to the Missionary-box
or not. At length she compromised,
by putting in half-a-crown. But conscience
would not let her rest: she went to bed, but
could not sleep; she arose, took back the
half-crown, put in the sovereign, went to bed
and slept comfortably. A few days afterwards,
to her great surprise, she received a
double letter, franked, and on opening it, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
no less astonished than delighted to find
twenty pounds from the widow lady, and five
pounds from the little girl in deep mourning.
And who were that lady and that little girl,
do you think? No other than her Royal
Highness the Duchess of Kent and our present
rightful and youthful sovereign."</p>

<p>"During one of the summer seasons of the
Princess's childhood the Duchess of Kent resided
in the neighbourhood of Malvern, and
almost daily walked on the Downs. One
day the Princess and her beautiful little dog
Pero, of which she was uncommonly fond,
happening considerably to outstrip the Duchess
and governess, she overtook a little peasant
girl about her own age. With the thoughtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hilarity of youth she made up to her,
and without ceremony, said to her&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My dog is very tired, will you carry
him for me if you please?'</p>

<p>"The good-natured girl, quite unconscious
of the rank of the applicant, immediately
complied, and tripped along by the side of
the Princess for some time in unceremonious
conversation. At length she said,</p>

<p>"'I am tired now, and cannot carry
your dog any farther.'</p>

<p>"'Tired!' cried her Royal Highness,
'Impossible! Think what a little way
you have carried him!'</p>

<p>"'Quite far enough,' was the homely
reply; 'besides, I am going to my aunt's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and if your dog must be carried, why
cannot you carry him yourself?'</p>

<p>"So saying, she placed Pero on the grass,
and he again joyfully frisked beside his
royal mistress.</p>

<p>"'Going to your aunt's;' rejoined the
Princess, unheeding Pero's gambols; 'pray
who is your aunt?'</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Johnson, the miller's wife.'</p>

<p>"'And where does she live?'</p>

<p>"'In that pretty little white house which
you see just at the bottom of the hill,
there;' said the unconscious girl, pointing
it out among the trees; and the two
companions stood still that the Princess
might make sure that she was right, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
giving the Duchess and her companion time
to come up.</p>

<p>"'Oh, I should like to see her!' exclaimed
the light-hearted Princess; 'I will go with
you, come let us run down the hill together.'</p>

<p>"'No, no, my Princess,' cried the governess,
coming up and taking her Royal
Highness's hand, 'you have conversed long
enough with that little girl, and now the
Duchess wishes you to walk with her.</p>

<p>"The awful words 'Princess' and 'Duchess'
quite confounded the little peasant girl;
blushing and almost overcome, she earnestly
begged pardon for the liberties she had taken,
but her fears were instantly allayed by the
Duchess, who, after thanking her for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
trouble in carrying Pero, recompensed her
by giving her half-a-crown.</p>

<p>"Delighted, the little girl curtsied her
thanks, and running on briskly to her aunt's,
she related all that had passed, dwelling particularly
on the apprehension she had felt
when she discovered that it was the Princess
whom she had desired to carry her dog
herself. The half-crown was afterwards
framed and hung up in the miller's homely
parlour, as a memento of this pleasing little
adventure."</p>

<p>"This is but a childish story, but Peter
Parley loves to hear stories of good children,
and he knows that his little friends love to
hear them too."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>PARLEY CONTINUES HIS ANECDOTES OF THE QUEEN.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">There</span> was one anecdote of the Queen from
which Peter Parley derived much pleasure,
because it showed that, notwithstanding her
high station, she is not unmindful of Him
by whom 'Kings reign, and Princes decree
justice.'</div>

<p>"A noble lord, one of her Majesty's ministers
of state, not particularly remarkable for
his observance of holy ordinances, recently
arrived at Windsor Castle late one Saturday
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I have brought down for your Majesty's
inspection,' he said, 'some papers of importance,
but as they must be gone into at length
I will not trouble your Majesty with them
to-night, but request your attention to them
to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>"'To-morrow morning!' repeated the
Queen; 'to-morrow is Sunday, my lord.'</p>

<p>"'But business of state, please your Majesty&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Must be attended to, I know,' replied
the Queen, 'and as of course you could not
come down earlier to-night, I will, if those
papers are of such vital importance, attend to
them <i>after we come from church to-morrow
morning</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"To church went the royal party; to
church went the noble lord, and much to his
surprise the sermon was on '<i>The duties of
the Sabbath</i>!'</p>

<p>"'How did your lordship like the sermon?'
enquired the young Queen.</p>

<p>"'Very much, your Majesty,' replied the
nobleman, with the best grace he could.</p>

<p>"'I will not conceal from you,' said the
Queen, 'that last night I sent the clergyman
the text from which he preached. I hope we
shall all be the better for it.'</p>

<p>"The day passed without a single word on
the subject of the 'papers of importance,'
and at night, when her Majesty was about to
withdraw, 'To-morrow morning, my lord,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
she said, 'at any hour you please, and as
early as seven if you like, we will go into
these papers.'</p>

<p>"His lordship could not think of intruding
at so early an hour on her Majesty; 'Nine
would be quite time enough.'</p>

<p>"'As they are of importance, my lord, I
would have attended to them earlier, but at
nine be it;' and at nine her Majesty was
seated ready to receive the nobleman, who
had been taught a lesson on the duties of
the sabbath, it is hoped, he will not quickly
forget.</p>

<p>"Exemplary as the young Queen is in her
religious duties, however, Peter Parley was
pleased to find that she does not allow her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
religion to consist in mere theory, but that
in reality she clothes the poor and feeds the
hungry.</p>

<p>"On one occasion when her Majesty, accompanied
by her suite, was taking an airing
on horseback, in the neighbourhood of
Windsor, she was overtaken by a heavy
shower, which forced the royal party to
seek shelter in an outhouse belonging to a
farm yard, where a poor man was busily
employed making hurdles. Her Majesty
entered into conversation with the man (who
was totally ignorant who he was addressing),
and finding that he had a large
family and no means of supporting them
beyond what he gained by making these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hurdles, her Majesty enquired where he
lived, and on taking her departure presented
him with a sovereign. Next day she went,
accompanied by her Royal Mother, to the
cottage of the poor man, and finding his
statement to be correct, immediately provided
some good warm clothing for his wife
and children. Her Majesty seemed very
much pleased with the neatness and regularity
of the cottage, and on taking her
departure presented the poor woman with a
five-pound note.</p>

<p>"There was no end to stories of this description,
but I can only afford room for two
or three more; one of which, in particular,
shows how early the Queen has been taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to look up to the only source of real comfort
in affliction.</p>

<p>"An old man who once served in the
capacity of porter to the Duke of Kent, and
who, in his old age and infirmity, has long
since been pensioned by the Duchess, is not
a little gratified at receiving a nod of recognition
from her Majesty whenever her carriage
chances to pass his cottage. The aged man
has a daughter much afflicted, and who has
been confined to bed for eight or ten years.
On the evening of the late king's funeral this
young woman was equally surprised and delighted
at receiving from the Queen a present
of the psalms of David in which was a marker
worked by herself with a dove, the emblem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of peace, in the centre. It pointed to
the forty-first psalm, which her Majesty requested
she would read, at the same time expressing
a hope that its frequent perusal
might bring an increase of peace to her
mind.</p>

<p>"Another poor man named Smith, who had
for several years swept the crossing opposite
the avenue leading to Kensington palace, and
whom her Majesty always kindly noticed,
rarely passing through the gates without
throwing him some silver from the carriage
window, received a message on the morning
after the Queen's accession informing him
that her Majesty had ordered that a weekly
allowance of eight shillings should be regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
paid him. The poor man, however, did
not long enjoy his pension, dying within six
months from its commencement.</p>

<p>"Short and brilliant as has been her Majesty's
career however, and fondly and carefully
as she has been watched over, her life affords
a very striking instance of providential preservation.</p>

<p>"During one of their summer excursions
on the southern coast of England, the Royal
party sailed in the Emerald yacht, and proceeding
up the harbour at Plymouth for the
purpose of landing at the dock-yard, the
yacht unfortunately, from the rapidity of the
tide, ran foul of one of the hulks which lay off
the yard. The shock was so great that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
mainmast of the royal yacht was sprung in
two places, and her sail and gaff (or yard by
which the sail is supported) fell instantaneously
upon the deck.</p>

<p>"The Princess happened unfortunately to
be standing almost directly under the sail at
the moment, and the most fatal consequences
might have ensued, had not the master of the
yacht, with admirable presence of mind,
sprung forward and caught her in his arms
and conveyed her to a place of safety. The
alarm and confusion caused by the accident
was for a time heightened by the uncertainty
as to the fate of her Royal Highness, who had
been preserved from injury by the blunt but
well-timed rescue of the honest sailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"'There is one thing which pleases me
mightily, Mr. Parley,' said Major Meadows,
'and it is this, that with all this goodness our
young Queen has a truly British heart. Often
and often has she manifested this, and when
quite a girl though perfectly acquainted with
several European languages, and particularly
with French and German, she never could be
prevailed upon to converse in them as a
habit, always observing that 'she was a
little English girl and would speak nothing
but English.' There is a healthiness of
feeling in this, Mr. Parley, which is quite
delightful.'</p>

<p>"Long before Major Meadows had finished
his anecdotes about the Queen we had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
home. As it is the custom to dine late in
London, we dined after our return, and during
the repast, the Queen and the spectacle
of to-morrow formed the chief subject of
conversation, my friend continuing from time
to time to give interest by some new anecdote,
of which his store seemed to be inexhaustible.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley is fond of early hours, so we
retired to bed betimes, which was the more
necessary, because by sun-rise to-morrow we
must be up and away to Westminster Abbey."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>PARLEY DESCRIBES WESTMINSTER ABBEY ON THE MORNING OF
THE CORONATION, AND RELATES THE LEGENDS CONNECTED
WITH ST. EDWARD'S CHAIR.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Early</span> in the morning, Peter Parley was
up and dressed. He had hardly finished his
devotions when, early though it was, Major
Meadows knocked at the door of his room
to enquire if he was stirring.</div>

<p>"After partaking of a hurried breakfast we
got into a carriage and drove to the Abbey.
As we passed along, we found people, even
at such an early hour, already begun to
congregate in the streets, and to take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
stations from which they expected to obtain
the best view of the day's proceedings.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" width="465" height="600" alt="royal entourage" />
<div class='attrib'><i>Madeley lith. 3, Wellington St. Strand.</i></div>
<div class="caption">HER MAJESTY LEAVING HER PRIVATE APARTMENTS IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</div>
</div>

<p>"Peter Parley was pleased to find, on our
arrival at the Abbey, that the doors had
been opened a short time before, and the
crowd of eager expectants who had been
waiting, some of them upwards of an hour,
had been already admitted. We were thus
saved the necessity of exposing ourselves to
being crushed by stronger and more energetic
claimants for admission.</p>

<p>"On entering the venerable building I
was struck mute with astonishment at the
magnificence of the preparations which now
burst upon the sight with all their breadth
and effect; though I had seen it so recently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I was not at all aware of the greatness of
the scale on which they had been undertaken.</p>

<p>"The approach to the theatre was by six
broad steps leading from the vestibule under
the music gallery. At the termination of the
choir, just where it is intersected by the
north and south transepts, a similar number
of steps led to a large platform, covered
with a splendid carpet in rich puce and gold
colours. Upon this platform was raised a
second of a smaller size, approached by four
broad steps, each covered with carpeting of
the most magnificent description. The fifth
step, which formed the platform, was covered
with cloth of gold, and in the centre was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
placed a splendid throne of a rich gilt
ground, tastefully embellished with rose-coloured
sprigs at short intervals, and the royal
initials in the centre.</p>

<p>"A little further in advance of this splendid
throne, and nearer the altar, stood a
chair of a more humble bearing, but far
more interesting, from the legendary stories
connected with it. This was St. Edward's
chair, of which Peter Parley must say a few
words.</p>

<p>"The chair is made of solid oak, and
beneath the seat is deposited a large stone,
on which the Scottish kings used to be
crowned. The legendary history of this
stone is very curious. It commences as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
early as the time of Jacob, who is said to
have rested his head on it in the plain of
Luz, when, as you will recollect, he fled from
the anger of his brother Esau. It was afterwards
carried to Spain, by the Scythians,
whence it found its way into Ireland in the
time of Romulus and Remus, the founders
of Rome. Here, it seems, from all accounts,
first to have exhibited miraculous powers&mdash;making
a 'prodigious noise, and being surprisingly
disturbed,' whenever a prince of
the Scythian line was seated upon it. Peter
Parley would not have you believe any of
these marvellous legends, none of which are
true, but which are interesting nevertheless,
as they serve to show in what manner the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
people of former times were misled by the
silly and ridiculous legends of the darker
ages.</p>

<p>"From Ireland this singular stone was
carried into Scotland, and placed in the
Abbey of Scone, where the coronation of
the Kings of Scotland usually took place.
One of the Scottish kings caused an inscription
to be cut upon it, an ancient prophecy,
as it was said, but more probably an invention
of some monkish chronicler of the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"If Fate speak sooth, where'er this stone is found,<br />
The Scots shall monarch of that realm be crown'd."<br />
</div>

<p>"When Edward I. dethroned Baliol, he
sent this celebrated stone, on the possession
of which the Scots set great value, to London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
along with the Scottish regalia. In
the following year, the monarch presented
these trophies at the shrine of St. Edward
the Confessor; and it appears soon afterwards
to have been placed in the coronation chair,
where it has remained ever since.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley has heard that the ancient
prophecy, to which even at so late a period
the more superstitious amongst the Scottish
nation clung, was held to be fulfilled when
James I. ascended the throne of England;
and it is also said not to have been without
a certain influence in reconciling many of
the people to the Union with England.</p>

<p>"But we must not forget the coronation
in Westminster Abbey, in our interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the legend connected with St. Edward's
chair.</p>

<p>"On each side of the platform on which
the thrones stood, were the galleries appropriated
for Peers and Peeresses and their
friends, also those for the Lord Mayor,
Aldermen, and Privy Councillors.</p>

<p>"There were two other galleries rising
above these on each side, the highest quite
among the vaultings of the roof, which were
appropriated indiscriminately to the rest of
the visitors.</p>

<p>"The whole of these extensive galleries
were covered with crimson cloth, and trimmed
with gold fringe, which had a very rich
effect when contrasted with the sombre colours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and antique stone walls of the building.</p>

<p>"The decorations of the chancel and altar
were of the most gorgeous description; the
draperies being of the richest purple silk,
brocaded in the most sumptuous pattern with
gold. Behind the altar the decorations were
of a still more delicate character than the
rest, both the ground-work and the gold
being of a lighter shade. Against the compartment
behind the altar stood six massive
gold plateaux, two of them being of very
large dimensions. The table itself was
loaded with a gold communion service, as
well as with other articles used in the ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peter Parley had time to notice all these
things from being in the Abbey so early in
the morning, before the visitors were so
numerous, and the place so crowded as it
afterwards became. The good sense and
knowledge of Major Meadows led him to
select a seat from which, while we could
see as much of the ceremony as nine-tenths
of those within the Abbey, we could
readily retire to the roof, from which we
could obtain an admirable view of the procession
outside.</p>

<p>"By six o'clock in the morning the visitors
began to arrive in the interior of the
Abbey, and bustle and confusion began to
prevail, where, but an hour before, all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
been stillness and silence; the rich and
elegant dresses of the ladies giving an air of
gaiety to the scene. An hour later the Peers
and Peeresses began to make their appearance,
and the attention was kept completely
on the alert by some new arrival of a distinguished
personage, or of a rich or picturesque
costume."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"At length the sound of the Park guns
announced that the Queen had entered her
carriage and was on her way to the Abbey.
This joyful announcement seemed to inspire
every one present with joy and animation.
The Peers, who had hitherto dispersed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
over various parts of the building,
giving, by their rich and picturesque costumes,
additional brilliancy and variety to
the already gorgeous scene, now retired to
their appointed places, and a certain degree
of order began to prevail within the Abbey.</p>

<p>"As the procession began to draw near,
Peter Parley took advantage of Major Meadows'
foresight, and, with some little difficulty,
made his way to the roof, to view its
approach."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>PARLEY DESCRIBES THE PROCESSION TO WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">From</span> this elevated and commanding position
Peter Parley had a most admirable view
of the procession, and of the immense multitude
of spectators which lined the streets and
crowded every window and roof from which
even the most distant and casual view of it
could be obtained.</div>

<p>"Far as the eye could reach was one dense
mass of human beings. The deafening cheers
of the populace, the waving of ten thousand
handkerchiefs, the clang of martial music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and the novelty and singularity of the whole
scene, well nigh turned the head of poor
Peter Parley.</p>

<p>"He had hardly time to satisfy his old eyes
with gazing on the immense assemblage
when the procession began to approach.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley will not attempt to give you
an exact list of the procession, for he knows
very well that a simple catalogue of names
would not at all interest you; he will therefore
merely run hastily over the principal
parts of it, and show you drawings of several
of the most striking scenes, which he knows
very well will give you by one glance a
clearer idea of it than if he were to spend
hours in mere description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Preceded by a squadron of horse-guards,
whose gallant and warlike bearing excited
general admiration, came the carriages of
the foreign ministers resident in this country.
Even in the midst of so much bustle, Peter
Parley could not help moralizing on the singularity
of the scene. Here were the representatives
of every power on the face of the
globe gathered together in one harmonious
congregation; and the feelings to which
their passing thus in review, in a living
panorama as it were, gave rise were of the
most peculiar description. Here were all
separate and rival interests for the moment
buried in oblivion, and people from the east,
from the west, and from the north, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the south, came to assist in doing honour to
England's Queen.</p>

<p>"Immediately behind the resident ministers
followed the ambassadors extraordinary, that
is, those who had been sent by their respective
governments for the express purpose
of taking part in the solemnity. Some of
the carriages and trappings of these ambassadors
excited the greatest attention and
admiration. Those in particular of Marshal
Soult, the French ambassador, one of the
ablest opponents of the Duke of Wellington
during the peninsular war, were rich almost
beyond description. In colour his carriage
was of a rich cobalt relieved with gold,
the panels most tastefully ornamented with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his Excellency's armorial bearings, at the
back of which was a field-marshal's baton.
It was furnished at each corner with a lamp
surmounted by a massive silver coronet, and
the raised cornices with which it was ornamented
were of silver, deep and richly chased.
These, with the beautiful harness (of
white&mdash;the furniture was also of silver exquisitely
chased), gave an air of richness and
beauty to the whole equipage which was
quite unequalled in the procession. Peter
Parley thought he should never have done
gazing at the rich and splendid equipage.</p>

<p>"The carriages and attendants of the ambassador
from the Sultan, though far less richly
caparisoned, were objects of equal curiosity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
partly on account of the eastern dress in
which Ahmed Fetij Pasha appeared, and
partly because of that undefined idea of
romance which exists in the popular mind in
connection with the crescent and the rising
sun, the emblems of Turkish power.</p>

<p>"The carriage was of a rich lake colour,
with the emblems which Peter Parley has
just mentioned richly emblazoned on the
panels. Inside it was lined with crimson
and yellow silk, in rich festoons; the hammercloth
blue, with gold and scarlet hangings,
the centre of scarlet velvet with the
rising sun and crescent in diamonds.</p>

<p>"The only other ambassador's carriage
which Peter Parley shall notice is that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the Prince de Ligne, ambassador extraordinary
from Belgium. I mention it not that
it was very much more striking than the
others, for they were all beautiful, and each
was distinguished by some peculiarity of
elegant chasteness or rich display. The carriage,
which was also of rich lake tastefully
ornamented with gold, was drawn by six
beautiful grey horses, and was preceded by
a couple of outriders likewise mounted on
greys. His Excellency's armorial bearings
were emblazoned on the panels, the roof
ornamented by four gold coronets, one at
each corner. The richness of the liveries
and trappings made this equipage very much
admired. After the foreign ambassadors followed
a mounted band and a detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
of life-guards which preceded the carriages
of the branches of the Royal Family.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley cannot find a word to express
his idea of the gorgeous magnificence
of the carriage of the Duchess of Kent, the
mother of the Queen. The masses of gold
lace by which the hammercloth and the
attendants' liveries were ornamented had an
extremely rich effect. Her grace seemed
highly delighted with the ceremony, and
nothing could be more gratifying than her
reception, unless indeed it was that of
the Queen herself. Every where was the
Duchess cheered, and she returned the people's
greetings by smiling and bowing in the
blandest and most courtly manner.</p>

<p>"The Duchess of Gloucester, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex, followed
next in order, and each was received with
the same warm and enthusiastic cheers.</p>

<p>"After these came the Queen's bargemaster
and his assistants, forty-eight in number.
The blunt sailor-like appearance of these
men, some of whose weather-beaten countenances
gave token of years of service, excited
much interest. When Peter Parley
saw them they recalled to his mind the anecdote
of the saving of the life of the Princess
Victoria, and he wondered which of the bluff
sailors it was who had been so ready and
so thoughtful.</p>

<p>"The Royal carriages now approached.
These were twelve in number, each drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by six splendid horses, and accompanied by
two grooms walking on each side. As
they passed in succession, the interest became
more intense as her Majesty drew nigh.
The beauty of the maids of honour, the
courtly bearing and gay dresses of the lords
in waiting, which the carriages conveyed,
the richness of the trappings, and the beauty
and spirit of the horses, excited the intensest
admiration. At length the twelfth carriage
passed, and the most breathless interest prevailed.
A squadron of Life Guards and a
mounted band preceded the military staff
and aides-de-camps, including some of the
most distinguished military officers of the
day. The Royal Huntsmen next appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
followed by six of her Majesty's horses, with
rich trappings, each led by two grooms.
Though nothing could be finer than the appearance
of these most beautiful animals the
amount of attention which they received was
but small, for close behind, preceded by one
hundred Yeomen of the Guard, appeared the
state coach, drawn by eight cream-coloured
horses, attended by a Yeoman of the Guard
at each wheel, and two footmen at each door,
conveying</p>

<div class='center'>
"THE QUEEN.<br />
</div>

<p>"The cheering by which other parts of
the cavalcade had been received was loud
and heartfelt, but no sooner did the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and amiable Queen make her appearance,
than the loudest and most enthusiastic plaudits
rent the air. The ladies in the balconies
waved their handkerchiefs, the people
cheered, peal after peal of joyful applause
came thundering upon the ear, shout followed
shout, and acclamation burst after acclamation,
until the music of the military
bands and the discharges of the artillery were
completely drowned in the roar of popular
applause. The Queen seemed to enjoy the
exciting scene, and continued bowing on all
sides in the most graceful and engaging
manner.</p>

<p>"The excitement which prevailed along
the line of the procession, as her Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
approached, was, Peter Parley was assured,
great beyond description. <i>Then</i> were the
rich trappings of the Foreign Ambassadors,
the magnificence of the Royal carriages, the
dazzling scarlet uniforms of the watermen,
the magnificently caparisoned horses, the
rich uniforms of the great officers of state,
and even the beauty and attractions of the
maids of honour, all forgotten. There was
one and one only thought of&mdash;it was <span class="smcap">the
Queen</span>. The struggle was to look upon
her, and the object of each individual present
seemed to be&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'How and which way he might bestow himself,<br />
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.'<br />
</p>

<p>"Never, Peter Parley will venture to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
did British monarch receive more heartfelt
greeting, or pass under brighter auspices
within the portals of Westminster Abbey."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>PARLEY DESCRIBES THE CORONATION IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the Queen, the great object
of attraction, had passed, Peter Parley and
his friend hurried into the Abbey to resume
their places. As they entered they encountered
the most deafening and enthusiastic
plaudits, to which the announcement of her
Majesty's arrival within the Abbey gave rise.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"While her Majesty was undergoing the
ceremony of robing, in the magnificent room
which Peter Parley has already told you
about, the procession, which forms part of
the ceremony within the Abbey, was arranged
in order.</p>

<p>"Every thing having been prepared, her
Majesty made her appearance habited in a
rich mantle and train of crimson velvet, over
a dress of satin wrought with gold, and the
assembled thousands of her loyal subjects
rose with one accord, and welcomed their
Sovereign in a manner which must have
thrilled the heart of the greatest potentate
who ever swayed a sceptre. The band of
instrumental music swelled forth their richest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
notes, and the choir gave magnificent effect
to the anthem:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I was glad when they said unto me
we will go into the house of the Lord. For
there is the Seat of Judgment, even the Seat
of the House of David. O pray for the
peace of Jerusalem; they shall prosper that
love Thee. Peace be within thy walls and
prosperity within thy palaces. Glory be
to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning,
is now, and ever shall be, world without
end. Amen.'</p>

<p>"As the procession moved slowly up the
Abbey, the effect was most magnificent;
the splendour of the pageantry, the beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the young Queen, whose mild blue eyes
shone scarcely less brightly than the circlet
of diamonds which encompassed her beauteous
brow, and the rich effect of the music,
as it reverberated among the aisles of the
building, almost made Peter Parley think it
was a scene in fairy-land, or one of those
bright and unsubstantial visions which flit
across the mind in our dreams.</p>

<p>"The Queen having advanced to a chair
which had been provided for her, about midway
between the throne and the south side
of the altar, the noblemen and others who
composed the procession took up the stations
which had been appropriated for them; the
choir in the mean time continuing to chaunt
the anthem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"The cadences of the anthem had scarcely
died away among the aisles of the Abbey,
when Peter Parley was startled at the sound
of youthful voices, singing at their highest
pitch. He directed his eyes towards the
spot whence the sound proceeded, and found
it was the Westminster scholars, who, according
to an ancient and established custom,
greeted their sovereign with a kind of
chaunt, 'Vivat Victoria Regina!'</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of this chaunt, which,
though not the most harmonious, struck Peter
Parley as certainly not the least interesting
part of the greeting, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Great
Chamberlain, and the Earl Marshal, advanced
and commenced the ceremony of the Coronation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by what is called the Recognition;
that is, advancing towards each side of the
theatre in succession, they thus addressed
the assembled spectators:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Sirs, we here present unto you Queen
Victoria, the undoubted Queen of this realm;
wherefore all you who are come this day to
do your homage, are you willing to do the
same?'</p>

<p>"As the question was repeated on each
side, the Abbey rang with the joyful response
'God save Queen Victoria!' A flourish of
trumpets added to the enthusiasm of the
scene; and even Peter Parley, carried away
by the feeling of the moment, shouted forth
his acclamations, in as heartfelt a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as the most devoted of her Majesty's subjects.</p>

<p>"During this part of the ceremony, the
Queen remained standing by the chair on
which she had at first taken her seat, and
turned her face successively toward that part
of the Abbey to which the question was
addressed.</p>

<p>"When the enthusiastic cheering subsided
her Majesty resumed her seat, and preparations
were made for that part of the altar
service called the Oblation. The Bible, the
chalice, and patina, were placed upon the
altar, before which, two officers of the wardrobe
spread a rich cloth of gold, and laid
upon it a cushion for her Majesty to kneel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
upon. The Bishops who were to be engaged
in the service also advanced and put
on their copes.</p>

<p>"Every thing being ready, her Majesty,
supported by two bishops and preceded by
the great officers of state bearing the regalia,
approached the altar, and kneeling upon the
cushion, made the various offerings.</p>

<p>"The first, which consisted of a pall or
altar-cloth of gold, was delivered by an officer
of the wardrobe to the Lord Chamberlain,
and by him handed to the Lord Great Chamberlain,
who delivered it to the Queen. Her
Majesty then gave it to the Archbishop of
Canterbury, by whom it was placed on the
altar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"An ingot of gold, a pound in weight,
was then handed by the Treasurer of the
Household to the Lord Great Chamberlain,
by whom it was placed in the hands of the
Queen, who delivered it to the Archbishop,
by whom it was put into the oblation basin,
and set upon the altar.</p>

<p>"The Archbishop then said the following
prayer, the Queen remaining kneeling before
the altar:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'O God, who dwellest in the high and
holy place, with them also who are of an
humble spirit, look down mercifully upon this
thy servant Victoria our Queen, here humbling
herself before Thee at thy footstool, and
graciously receive these oblations, which, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
humble acknowledgment of thy sovereignty
over all, and of thy great bounty unto her
in particular, she hath now offered up unto
Thee, through <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, our only mediator
and advocate. Amen.'</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of this prayer her
Majesty returned to the chair on the
south side of the altar, and the whole
of the regalia, except the swords, were delivered
to the archbishop and placed on the
altar.</p>

<p>"The Litany was then read by the Bishops
of Worcester and St. David's, which was
followed by the Communion Service, previous
to which, the choir sang the <i>Sanctus</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>
"'Holy! Holy! Holy! Lord God of Hosts;<br />
Heaven and earth are full of thy Glory;<br />
Glory be to Thee, O Lord, most High. Amen.'<br />
</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of the service the
Bishop of London ascended the pulpit, which
had been placed opposite her Majesty's chair
of state, and preached the sermon. His lordship's
text was chosen from 2 Chron. xxxiv.
31,&mdash;'And the King stood in his place and
made a covenant before the Lord, to walk
after the Lord, and to keep his commandments,
and his testimonies, and his statutes,
with all his heart, and with all his soul, to
perform the words of the covenant which
are written in this book.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"At the conclusion of the sermon, to which
the Queen was deeply attentive, the Archbishop
of Canterbury advanced toward her
Majesty, and standing before her, thus addressed
her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Madam, is your Majesty willing to take
the oath?'</p>

<p>"The Queen answered, 'I am willing.'</p>

<p>"The Archbishop then ministered these
questions; and the Queen answered each
question severally, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Archbishop.</i>&mdash;Will you solemnly promise
and swear to govern the people of this
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
and the dominions thereto belonging,
according to the statutes in Parliament agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
on, and the respective laws and customs of
the same?</p>

<p>"<i>Queen.</i>&mdash;I solemnly promise so to do.</p>

<p>"<i>Archbishop.</i>&mdash;Will you to the utmost of
your power cause law and justice, in mercy,
to be executed in all your judgments?</p>

<p>"<i>Queen.</i>&mdash;I will.</p>

<p>"<i>Archbishop.</i>&mdash;Will you to the utmost of
your power maintain the laws of God, the
true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant
reformed religion established by law?
And will you maintain and preserve inviolably
the settlement of the United Church of
England and Ireland, and the doctrine, worship,
discipline, and government thereof, as
by law established within England and Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and the territories thereunto belonging?
And will you preserve unto the bishops and
clergy of England and Ireland, and to the
churches there committed to their charge,
all such rights and privileges as by law
do or shall appertain to them, or any of
them?</p>

<p>"<i>Queen.</i>&mdash;All this I promise to do.</p>

<p>"The Queen then proceeded to the altar,
attended by the various functionaries, who
had taken up their stations about her, and
kneeling before it, laid her right hand on
the great Bible, and, in the sight of her
people, took a solemn oath, to observe the
promises which she had made, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The things which I have here before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
promised, I will perform and keep&mdash;So help
me, God.'</p>

<p>"Her Majesty then kissed the book and
set her royal sign manual to a copy of the
oath. After this solemn ceremony she returned
to the chair, and kneeling at her fald-stool,
the choir sang, with the most touching
effect, the magnificent hymn&mdash;</p>

<p>
"'Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire,<br />
And warm them with thy Heav'nly fire;<br />
Thou who th' Anointing Spirit art,<br />
To us thy sevenfold gifts impart;<br />
Let thy bless'd unction from above<br />
Be to us comfort, life, and love;<br />
Enable with celestial light<br />
The weakness of our mortal sight:<br />
Anoint our hearts, and cheer our face,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>With the abundance of thy grace.<br />
Keep far our foes, give peace at home&mdash;<br />
Where Thou dost dwell no ill can come.<br />
Teach us to know the Father, Son,<br />
And Spirit of both, to be but one,<br />
That so through ages all along,<br />
This may be our triumphant song;<br />
In Thee, O Lord, we make our boast,<br />
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.'"<br />

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>PARLEY CONTINUES HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE CORONATION IN
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">The</span> ceremony of anointing followed next
in order&mdash;Her Majesty having been divested
of her crimson robe by the Mistress
of the Robes, took her seat in St. Edward's
chair, and the Dean of Westminster taking
from the altar the ampulla, containing the
consecrated oil, and pouring some of it into
the anointing spoon, proceeded to anoint
her Majesty on the crown of the head and
on the palm of both hands, in the form of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
cross&mdash;four knights of the garter holding
over her head a rich cloth of gold.</div>

<p>"The Dean of Westminster then took the
spurs from the altar and delivered them to
the Lord Great Chamberlain, who, kneeling
before her Majesty, presented them to her,
after which she forthwith sent them back
to the altar. The Viscount Melbourne, who
carried the sword of state, then delivered it
to the Lord Chamberlain, receiving in lieu
thereof, another sword, in a scabbard of purple
velvet, which his lordship delivered to the
archbishop, who laid it on the altar. After
a short prayer the archbishop took the sword
from off the altar, and, accompanied by several
other bishops, delivered it into the Queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
right hand. Then rising up her Majesty
proceeded to the altar and offered the sword
in the scabbard, delivering it to the archbishop,
who placed it on the altar. Lord
Melbourne then redeemed it by payment of
one hundred shillings, and having unsheathed
it, bore it during the remainder of the
ceremony.</p>

<p>"The most important part of the ceremonial
now approached: the Dean of Westminster
having received the imperial mantle of cloth
of gold, lined or furred with ermine, proceeded
to invest her Majesty, who stood up
for the purpose. Having resumed her seat,
the orb with the cross was brought from the
altar, and delivered into her Majesty's hand by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the archbishop; having in like manner been
invested with the ring, the sceptre and the
rod with the dove were placed in each hand.
The archbishop, then, standing before the
altar, took the crown into his hands, and
again laying it on the altar said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'O God, who crownest thy faithful servants
with mercy and loving kindness, look
down upon this thy servant Victoria, our
Queen, who now in lowly devotion boweth
her head to thy divine majesty; and as thou
dost this day set a crown of pure gold upon
her head, so enrich her royal heart with thy
heavenly grace, and crown her with all
princely virtues, which may adorn the high
station wherein thou hast placed her, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, to whom be honour
and glory for ever and ever. Amen.'</p>

<p>"The Royal Crown was then brought
from the altar and placed on her Majesty's
head.</p>

<p>"At this instant the most deafening and
enthusiastic cries of '<span class="smcap">God save the Queen!</span>'
rose from every part of the Abbey, the peers
and peeresses put on their coronets, the
bishops their caps, and the spectators cheered
and waved their handkerchiefs. The guns
in the park, and at the tower, fired a royal
salute.</p>

<p>"After a short prayer by the archbishop,
the choir sang an anthem, and the Dean of
Westminster taking the Bible, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
been carried in the procession, from off the
altar, presented it to her Majesty, who, having
received it, delivered it again to the archbishop,
and it was returned to the altar.</p>

<p>"Having thus been solemnly anointed,
and crowned, and invested with all the
ensigns of royalty, the archbishop solemnly
blessed the Queen, the rest of the bishops
and the peers following every part of the benediction
with a loud and hearty 'Amen.'</p>

<p>"The <i>Te Deum</i> was then sung by the
choir, and her Majesty passing to the recognition
chair in which she first sat, received
the homage of the peers.</p>

<p>"The bishops first approached, and, kneeling
before the Queen, the archbishop pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the words of homage; the others
repeating them after him, and, kissing her
Majesty's hand, retired.</p>

<p>"The Royal Dukes, ascending the steps
of the throne, took off their coronets, and
kneeling, repeated the words of homage, and
then, touching the crown on her Majesty's
head, kissed her on the left cheek and
retired.</p>

<p>"The other Peers then performed their
homage, each in succession touching the
crown and kissing her Majesty's hand.</p>

<p>"The monotony of this ceremony was
relieved by one little incident which evinced
much kindness on the part of her Majesty. As
one of the peers (Lord Rolle), who is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
aged and infirm man, approached the throne,
he stumbled and fell back from the second
step upon the floor. He was immediately
raised, and supported by two noble lords;
when he again approached, her Majesty, who
beheld the occurrence with emotion, rose
from her throne and advanced to meet him,
extending her hand to him, and expressed
much concern for the accident. This little
trait of genuine goodness of heart was warmly
cheered.</p>

<div class='attrib'><i>Madeley lith. 3, Wellington St. Strand.</i></div>
<div class="caption">HER MAJESTY'S STATE CARRIAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>"Peter Parley was highly amused at the
scene which was enacted behind the throne,
where one of her Majesty's Household was
busily engaged scattering the coronation
medals. Peers, Peeresses, Aldermen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Military officers engaging warmly in the
scramble and eagerly clutching at the coveted
memorials.</p>

<p>"When the homage was concluded, her
Majesty descended from the throne and, proceeding
to the altar, partook of the Holy
Sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p>"The procession was then marshaled in
the same order in which it had entered the
Abbey. The rich effect of the costumes was
however much heightened by the coronets of
the peers.</p>

<p>"After a short stay in the robing rooms,
the procession for the return to Buckingham
palace was formed, and the crowned Sovereign
left Westminster Abbey amid the enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
greeting of her faithful and devoted
subjects.</p>

<p>"Of course, there were many poems and
songs made on this joyful occasion. The
best which Peter Parley has seen is one by
Charles Swain, which will form a very
appropriate conclusion to this chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>PARLEY GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF THE ILLUMINATIONS, AND OF
THE GRAND DISPLAY OF FIRE-WORKS.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">After</span> the splendid pageant, which had
rivetted the attention of every one during
its continuance, had passed away, the fair
in Hyde Park seemed to be the great centre
of popular attraction.</div>

<p>"Though pretty well tired out with the
unusual exertion of the last day or two,
Peter Parley proceeded to Hyde Park to see
what was going on there. He had come
across the Atlantic to see the show, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was determined to see all that was to be
seen.</p>

<p>"How different an aspect did the park
now present to what it did when Peter Parley
visited it but two days before! The fair
was now begun in good earnest, and there
was no end to the booths for the sale of
fancy goods of every description. Tents for
the supply of articles of more substantial
enjoyment were in equal abundance, and
every one of them seemed to be completely
crowded. When Peter Parley had wandered
about the outskirts of the fair for some time,
he saw a great many people standing looking
at a large erection which seemed more
like a house than a tent. He soon recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the theatre of Mr. Richardson, which
he had seen erecting when he first visited
the park; as he drew near he saw that
the people were laughing and enjoying
the antics of a clown or merry-andrew,
who was dressed in a parti-coloured dress,
and was cutting the most ridiculous capers,
to the no small delight of the spectators.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley loves a little fun, and can
laugh as loud as any one at innocent amusement,
so he got close up to the booth to
see how the clown acquitted himself.</p>

<p>"'Come along, old boy!&mdash;this way, this
way, father Adam!' cried the fellow to Peter
Parley, when he saw him advancing&mdash;'make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
way there, ladies and gentlemen!' he continued,
leaping right over the head of a countryman
who was gazing at him with intense
delight, at the same time knocking his hat
over his eyes so as completely to blindfold
him. In an instant the clown stood beside
Peter Parley, and was hurrying him up the
steps of the theatre before he knew what
he was about. Peter Parley, however,
did not relish such a summary mode of
introduction, so he disengaged himself from
the fellow's grasp and moved to another
part of the fair, amid the rude laughter of
the by-standers.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley was amazed at the number
of round-abouts and swings of every description,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
which beat the air and performed their
evolutions with almost incessant rapidity.
Some of them in the form of boats, which
in the course of their movements rose and
sunk alternately so as to imitate the motion
of a vessel on the water, seemed particularly
ingenious and appeared to be in constant
request. Donkey races, too, lent their attractions,
and altogether such a scene of gaiety
Peter Parley never witnessed.</p>

<p>"As long as daylight lasted these out-of-door
amusements seemed to lose little or
none of their attractions. When it became
too dark for their performance people crowded
into the theatres and tents, or waited patiently
for the grand display of fireworks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
which was to take place at a late hour in
the evening.</p>

<p>"By way of making the most of his time
Peter Parley got into a hackney coach and
drove through the principal parts of the town
to see the illuminations, which it was expected
were to be on a grand scale.</p>

<p>"All along the line of the procession the
display was most splendid, and though many
of the exhibitions of private individuals were
beautiful and tasteful, the public offices certainly
carried off the palm. Peter Parley
thinks he never saw such a brilliant display
as that at the Ordnance Office, in Pall Mall,
the whole front of which was one blaze of
light. Peter Parley was told that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
no fewer than sixty thousand lamps employed
in the devices!</p>

<p>"The Admiralty, Somerset House, and the
Horse Guards, shared, with the Ordnance
Office, the attention of the evening. The
former displayed a magnificent imperial crown
surmounting an anchor, with the union flag
on each side in coloured lamps. It had also
an inscription, 'God save the Queen.'</p>

<p>"Somerset House, in which are several
of the public offices, excited a good deal of
attention from a novelty in the art of illumination.
Instead of being lighted up with
oil, the coloured lamps were illuminated with
gas, which added greatly to their brilliancy
and effect. The Horse Guards was, also, lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
up in the same manner, and was equally
attractive.</p>

<p>"There were, besides these, hundreds of
others well worth looking at and remembering
too; but so many attractions offered
themselves to his notice on every side, that
Peter Parley does not know which to tell
you about.</p>

<p>"After being satisfied with gazing at the
illuminations, Peter Parley again proceeded
to the Park, as the time approached for the
grand display of fireworks.</p>

<p>"So dense was the crowd of eager spectators,
that it was with difficulty that Peter
Parley could gain access to the Park. He
succeeded at length, however, thanks to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
virtue of perseverance, which has done much
for him in the course of his life.</p>

<p>"The display commenced by the discharge
of what is called a maroon battery, which
fired off successively a series of immense
crackers, each giving a report like the loudest
cannon. The commencement of the spectacle
was hailed with loud cheers by the
assemblage, many of whom had waited several
hours, and were beginning to lose all
patience at the delay.</p>

<p>"This startling display was immediately
followed by an exhibition of coloured fire,
and four balloon mortars shooting forth serpents
and squibs of every variety of colour.
The beautiful variety of tints, blue, green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
red, and purple, to which some of these
gave rise when they exploded in the air,
was most magnificent.</p>

<p>"For two whole hours did the gentlemen
who had the direction of this exhibition continue
the display, each successive variety vieing
in beauty and brilliancy with that by
which it was preceded, to the delight of all
beholders, many of whom, and Peter Parley
among others, never witnessed such a grand
sight. The young Queen, it was said, enjoyed
the splendour and beauty of the sight
from the palace window, with as much interest
and delight as any of her subjects.</p>

<p>"It was almost one o'clock before the
fireworks were concluded, and nearly an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
later before Peter Parley could make his
way home; and the sun rose high in heaven
before he awoke next morning.</p>

<p>"Peter Parley must not omit to mention
that all the theatres and places of public
amusement were, by her Majesty's command,
open to the public free; of course they were
all filled, but Peter Parley did not visit any
of them.</p>

<p>"It pleased Peter Parley to hear that the
poor and the unfortunate were no less kindly
attended to. In almost every parish committees
were formed by the inhabitants for
the purpose of collecting subscriptions and
arranging matters for regaling the poor and
the children attending the charity schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
so that to all the 28th of June should be
a day of rejoicing. Nor were the unfortunate
inhabitants of the prisons forgotten. In
all those belonging to the city, they were
each allowed an ample repast, and in some
of the others the great brewers supplied them
with a good allowance of ale or porter."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>PARLEY ATTENDS A REVIEW IN HYDE PARK, AND RELATES SOME
PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF MARSHAL SOULT.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Peter Parley</span> had begun to recover from
the fatigue which he had undergone, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thinking of once more crossing the Atlantic,
and returning to the enjoyment of his quiet
home, when one morning at breakfast, Major
Meadows announced that there was to be a
grand review in Hyde Park, on a scale of
such splendour, that Peter Parley must see
it before he left town.</div>

<p>"The day fortunately turned out one of
the most beautiful that could be conceived,
and the crowds of persons who assembled to
witness the grand military display, were
very great. It was estimated by some of
the military officers, who are accustomed to

<div class="caption">MARSHAL SOULT'S STATE CARRIAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>"Early in the day the troops began to arrive,
and by ten o'clock all the regiments to be
reviewed were on the ground. Shortly after,
the Duke of Wellington, Lord Hill, and a
great number of English military officers, as
well as Marshal Soult, and all the foreign
ambassadors, attended by their brilliant suites,
arrived, and were every where received with
great cheering.</p>

<p>"At half-past eleven her Majesty arrived
accompanied by her suite in four carriages,
each drawn by four horses, and escorted by a
detachment of Life Guards. She was attended
by her Aides-de-Camp in full military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
uniform. The arrival of the royal party was
announced by a discharge of cannon, the band
striking up the national anthem, and the
soldiers presenting arms as her Majesty
approached.</p>

<p>"The great attraction among the foreign
visitants was Marshal Soult, who, as usual,
excited much attention. As he rode close
past the spot where Peter Parley and his
friend Major Meadows had taken their stand,
his stirrup broke, and we feared he would
have fallen from his horse, but the Marshal
is a good rider, and quickly recovered. Peter
Parley afterwards saw a curious anecdote in
the newspapers connected with this accident.
On learning what had happened, Sir H.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Vivian immediately dispatched a messenger
to the saddlers to the Ordnance, to procure a
pair of stirrups to replace the broken one.
It happened, singularly enough, that the Saddlers
had in their possession the stirrups
which Napoleon used in many of his campaigns;
so that Marshal Soult, during this
review, actually did what was next to standing
in his master's shoes!</p>

<p>"Seeing that Peter Parley was very much
interested in the Marshal, Major Meadows,
who had been engaged in the Peninsular war,
and had fought against him in some of his
most celebrated battles, continued, when our
attention was not completely occupied by the
evolutions of the troops, to relate many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
most interesting anecdotes of his distinguished
career.</p>

<p>"'Marshal Soult,' said Major Meadows,
'is a very singular man, Mr. Parley, and like
many of Napoleon's generals, rose from the
very humblest rank. He entered the army
as a private soldier, and, after serving some time
in this capacity in a royal regiment of infantry,
he became sub-lieutenant of grenadiers.</p>

<p>"'He afterwards rose through the various
ranks, till in 1796 he was appointed general
of brigade, and sent to join the army of Italy.
Here he soon won for himself new laurels,
and his fame attracted the notice of Napoleon,
who henceforth honoured him with his personal
esteem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"'On the eve of the memorable battle of
Austerlitz, in which he was entrusted with
the command of the centre of the army,
Napoleon, as usual, called his marshals together
to explain his plans to them, and to
give them instructions for their guidance. To
the others he was minute in his directions, in
proportion to the importance of the posts
assigned to them. When he came to Soult,
however, he merely said, 'as for you, Soult,
I have only to say, act as you always do.'</p>

<p>"'In the midst of the battle, an aide-de-camp
arrived with an order that the Marshal should
instantly push forward and gain certain
heights. 'I will obey the Emperor's commands
as soon as I can,' replied Soult, 'but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
this is not the proper time.' Napoleon, enraged
at the delay, sent a second messenger,
with more peremptory orders. The second
aide-de-camp arrived just as the Marshal was
putting his column in motion. The man&#339;uvre
had been delayed because Soult observed
that his opponents were extending their lines,
and, consequently, weakening their centre.
Complete success attended the attack. Napoleon,
who, from the elevated position which
he occupied, saw the attack, instantly perceived
the reason for the delay, and the brilliancy
of the movement, and riding up to
Soult, complimented him in the presence of
his staff, who, but a few minutes before, had
seen him angry at the supposed disobedience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
saying, 'Marshal, I account you the ablest
tactician in my empire!'</p>

<p>"'After the battle of Eylau, Napoleon was
very much discouraged at the loss he had
sustained, and wished to fall back, so as to
form a junction with the other corps of his
army. Against this resolution Soult warmly
protested, telling the Emperor, that from what
he had seen, he expected the enemy would
retreat during the night, and thus leave the
French army in possession of the field. Napoleon
complied with the Marshal's advice,
and every thing took place just as he had
foretold. So that it was to the sagacity of
Soult that the French army owes the honour
of the victory of Eylau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"'In 1808, Soult, now Duke of Dalmatia,
was entrusted with the command of the army
in Spain, and his first movement was to pursue
the gallant Sir John Moore in his memorable
retreat towards Corunna. Under the
walls of that town he engaged the British
army, but, after a sharp contest, was completely
repulsed. The British general, however, was
killed in the action, and was buried in the
citadel, his corpse wrapped in a military cloak,
and the guns of his enemy paying his funeral
honours. Marshal Soult, with that noble
feeling which can only exist in minds of
true greatness erected a monument to his
memory, near the spot where he so nobly
fell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"'To the Duke of Dalmatia Napoleon
entrusted the command of the army, when the
defeat of the French at Vittoria had placed
the Peninsula at the mercy of the Duke of
Wellington. After a series of conflicts, which
covered the British army and its able general
with glory, Soult, finding the cause of his
imperial master hopeless, gave up the contest
and returned to Paris.</p>

<p>"'Soult afterwards fought at Waterloo,
but without that distinction which might have
been expected from his old renown. After
this battle, which for ever stamped the fate
of Napoleon, and showed Wellington the
greatest general of the age, Soult retired to
the country, and lived for some years in seclusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He was however recalled, and created
a peer of France by Charles X.'</p>

<p>"Such was Major Meadows' account of
this celebrated man. To Peter Parley he
was an object of great interest, because
his presence recalled the remembrance of
some of the spirit-stirring events in which
he had been a participator; not that Peter
Parley is an admirer of military genius or
delights in military renown. He would
rather do honour to the humblest benefactor
of the human race than the greatest general
that ever lived. With him the glory of
James Watt, the inventor of the steam-engine,
far outshines the lustre of a Soult, or a
Ney, or an Alexander! and he would rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be the author of the Waverley Novels than
be crowned with the blood-stained laurels of
a Napoleon or a Wellington!</p>

<p>"Peter Parley is one of those who hope
the time is now come when the sound of war
will be heard no more, and nations, instead
of wasting their energies in deeds of
blood, will strive to rival each other only
in the peaceful pursuits of commerce and the
arts."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Peter Parley must now bid his young
friends good bye! When he meets them again
he hopes to find them all equally willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to be pleased and as patient and attentive to
the tales which he tells them, as they have
been to his '<span class="smcap">Visit to London during
the Coronation of Queen Victoria</span>.'"</p>
